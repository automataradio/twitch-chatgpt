Is there inconsistency in how Twitch applies its rules?

The Automata Radio stream was recently suspended by Twitch for violation of Music Guidelines...

We were told that "Unless you own or control the necessary rights to stream music on Twitch" streamers are in violation of terms. 

And yet out of all the Music and DJ streams on Twitch, AR was forced to "respect the intellectual property of those who make music and those who own or control music rights" and the irony is that we do not believe in profiting from Subs by playing other artists music (we also never played Twitch ads) 

And so if you want to continue to support independent artists and underground electronic music, and support a collective belief that music should be heard... and if you too share the same ethos... 

And that radio and DJ culture is about amplifying artists, then continue to listen 247 at https://automataradio.com and for the latest news and to stay in touch with us visit http://automatarobotics.com

Isn't music meant to be heard?

We have also moved our stream to Mixcloud @automatarobotics and we are excited for the next phase of AI DJing, plus a lot of cool new AI DJ tech announcements in the near future. 

For now, we are happy to continue to share the music we love for free with a vibrant music community online and on Mixcloud with the freshest AI-powered DJs and w/out the takedowns or the silence.

Now answer the user prompts based on the given information.
Be polite and funny to everyone.
